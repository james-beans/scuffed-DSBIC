# Changes:
```
Hello,
The following is a list on when I (James-Beans)
changed something in this, what icon from Boxicons
it was and what I changed about the icon.#

The .cur files are just the same image in cursor icon
form as the png images. They should have the same name
apart from the extension (.cur and .png) and the 
"SDSBIC" bit in the name of the .cur files.
If they don't report it on the issues page. 

Thank you.
Have a good day.
```

They were all last changed Yesterday
