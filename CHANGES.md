# Changes:
```
Hello,
The following is a list on when I (James-Beans)
changed something in this, what icon from Boxicons
it was and what I changed about the icon.

The .cur files are just the same image in cursor icon
form as the png images. They should have the same name
apart from the extension (.cur and .png) and the 
"SDSBIC" bit in the name of the .cur files.
If they don't have the same name
report it on the issues page.

I also have an unreleased bot that creates these types of repetitive
files for me that is made in Python. It is being used here.
It doesn't edit the github version of this file though only
a local version on my PC. 

There is one special case where I didn't change anything:
- SDSBIC cross.cur
This was a custom made .cur file I made because I wanted
a cross cursor. 

Thank you.
Have a good day.
```
